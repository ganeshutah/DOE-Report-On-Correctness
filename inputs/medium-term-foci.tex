\noindent The following medium-term directions deserve significant attention:

\begin{compactitem}
\item Correctness verification of important properties in common HPC software components,
including math libraries and widely-used runtime systems such as OpenMP and MPI.

\item Building infrastructure to document previously solved correctness issues in 
the form of bug databases, bug test cases, best testing practices, as well as lightweight 
mechanisms to automate the extraction of such cases in HPC centers.

\item Standardize interfaces to allow composability of correctness checkers, 
defect isolation tools, and debuggers.

\item Investments in the modeling and specification of numerical algorithms,
ontologies for the mathematics of the underlying algorithms.

\item Support for reasoning about statistical and randomized systems,
Uncertainty Quantification and Automatic Differentiation.
