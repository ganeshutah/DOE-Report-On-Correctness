\begin{abstract}
Maintaining leadership in HPC requires the ability to support simulations at large scales and fidelity. 
%
In this study, we detail one of the 
most significant productivity challenges
in achieving this
goal, namely the increasing proclivity to 
bugs, especially in the face of growing
hardware and software heterogeneity and
sheer system scale.
%
We identify key areas where timely
new research must be proactively
begun to
address these challenges, and create 
new correctness tools
that must ideally play a significant
role even while ramping up toward
exacale. 
%
We close with the proposal for a two-day
workshop in which
the problems identified in this
report can be more broadly discussed, 
and specific plans to launch these 
new research thrusts identified.
