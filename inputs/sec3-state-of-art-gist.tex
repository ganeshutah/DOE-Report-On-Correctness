 There have been several
 notable successes in establishing
 rigorous methods in support for HPC.
 Many of today's successes lie in
 the use of
 static analysis, dynamic analysis,
 focused testing with non-determinism
 control, anomaly detection specific
 to HPC, and debuggers focused on HPC.
 The use of rigorous and systematic
 methods in many recent projects, while
 not as mature,
 has already shown considerable
 promise.
