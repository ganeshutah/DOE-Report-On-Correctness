 %\subsubsection{Definition of formal methods, and importance for HPC}
 


Formal methods are rigorous mathematical techniques for exhaustively checking that the
model of a system under analysis satisfies a set of desired properties.
%
The model in question could be: 
 (1)~a piece of code (e.g., the model of a numerical routine); or
\ignore{===
(2)~formalism underlying a particular
type of analysis (e.g., partial orders that describe a family of memory models, or a particular
formal model describing floating point arithmetic);
===}
(2)~a set of rules or axioms describing the behavior of some aspect of the system (for example, partial orders can describe the guarantees provided by a memory model, or a set of mathematical rules can describe the behavior of floating point arithmetic).
%
The second perspective is an example of formal methods   that are ``baked into'' analysis procedures or developed to
support specific lines of reasoning.

\ignore{===
or even 
(3)~formal models underlying
a compiler that produces a piece of stencil code based on its sketch.
 %
 The latter two  
 ===}


\ignore{==>
%
At the very least, the extent of expert involvement must be contained (e.g., one particular numerical routine), with the correctness of all code variants of that routine implied by formalized transformations.

 The main reason to emphasize formal methods is that HPC can learn
from the hardware industry where
{\em almost all chips that matter} are subject to some extent of formal analysis.
%
Often {\em semi-formal} adaptations work best in practice where the driving theory/formalism is the same, but the checking steps are bounded in some sense (e.g., concretizing some inputs, bounding the depth of exploration, selecting critical subsystems for analysis while under-approximating their environment, etc.).
%
Here are two examples:
\begin{compactitem}
\item No microprocessor gets shipped without its cache coherence protocols being 
subject to formal analysis and correction; this trend started with pioneering efforts
such as Loewenstein's
adaptation of David Dill's Murphi tool around
1991 at Sun Microsystems.
%
Even today, Murphi is the language of choice for modeling and verifying industrial cache coherence protocols.

Following the well-known Intel Pentium fiasco, all major chip manufacturers 
 have now adopted formal analysis to
 verify floating-point hardware.
 %
 In a recent project at Intel~\cite{roope-intel-fv-i7}, formal methods were deemed so
 successful in examining critical arithmetic units of Intel's core i7 that
 traditional simulation-based testing was largely eliminated.\footnote{In recognition of this success, the leader of
 this project,
 Roope Kaivola, won Microsoft's prestigious verified software award of 2014.}
 %
 
 
 Achieving this degree of adoption of formal
 methods in HPC is a coveted goal.
 %
 However, driving a formal methods agenda forward in HPC requires prudence, given the absence of an obvious failure cost model (as happens when chips emerge with silicon defects, where each mask re-spin costs millions of dollars), and
also given the sheer complexity of 
HPC software.
%
More practical are approaches where 
formal methods are baked into tools so that
everyday users are not confronted with
modeling their idiosyncratic pieces of
code.
\ignore{===
%
Instead, experts are charged with
formalizing their tools and underlying 
formal models.
 ===}
 
 \ignore{==>
 
  Exhaustively means 100\% of the state space of the model (simulation models only check about 1\% of the state space).
 \ggcmtside{Simulation models covering 1\% is too arbitrary; often we don't know how much we cover.}
 
A provably correct system is formally verified for a set of properties that provides complete coverage of system behavior 
Do verified properties cover all behaviors of the system?
For HPC codes
Need to extend formal methods to statistical reasoning in order to apply formal verification to scientific applications
Inputs can be large n-dimensional matrices
What is feasible, what is not? 
Need to run correct apps on provably correct system software (software stack), which needs to run on provably correct hardware.

\subsubsection{Driving forward a formal methods agenda in HPC}

Driving a formal methods agenda forward in HPC requires prudence, given the absence of an obvious failure cost model (as happens when chips emerge with silicon defects, where each mask re-spin costs millions of dollars), and
also given the sheer complexity of 
HPC software.
%
The recommended steps are to employ
formal methods baked into tools so that
everyday users are not confronted with
modeling their idiosyncratic pieces of
code; rather, experts are charged with
formalizing their tools and underlying 
formal models.
%
We highlight the following list of topics
as highly promising and 
exemplar (no means exhaustive) directions
to pursue in HPC applications of formal
methods.

%\begin{compactitem}
%\item 
Formal methods based on automata-theoretic modeling can be applied to expressing component interfaces in the form 
of interface automata (evolved at UCB in the early 1990s by
Henzinger et al), or learning the behavior of code that a human expert
does not understand (the latter has been
successfully applied in the Android 
operating system context).

%\item 
Formal methods can help narrow the gap
between low level traces and human understanding
of the code. These inverse-mapping relations are 
crucial to create in order to explain bugs in higher
level terms.

%\item 
Results obtained from recent efforts,
such as from the D-TEC project at MIT, help
transform stencil code written in Fortran
to a DSL (Halide), which is then code generated and optimized to any hardware platform, with formal verification that the transformation is correct.

%\item 
Given the shift toward automated data layout
and iteration-space optimizations achieved through
portability layers such as 
RAJA~\cite{RAJA-LLNL-TR}
and 
Kokkos~\cite{DBLP:journals/jpdc/EdwardsTS14},
the integrity of such ``tall compilation stacks'' 
can become single points of failure
due to bugs they can introduce in
all their generated code. 
%
On the flip side, these stacks can also serve
as
{\em single opportune points of intervention}
for maximally impactful uses of formal methods.

%\item 
Formal methods can provide the underpinnings
for code generation, for example
for different data layouts. The generated
code can provide a consistent representation, as well
as automation of the tradeoff-space exploration. Code
generation may also be able to encompass
the generation of complex data structures that are not feasible for humans to originate.


%\item 
For floating-point arithmetic and associated error versus performance tradeoff analysis, formal methods can provide safety-nets for enabling what practitioners like to do---i.e., push
on performance while skimping on precision.
Formal methods are essential
to define what is safe for the
situation at hand (error containment, ensuring convergence), as floating-point precision tuning 
cannot be done without modeling the usage context.

%\item 
In the area of formal shared memory consistency models, formal methods are the {\em only game in town} in the sense that ad hoc testing 
does not ensure anything.
%
More importantly, formal methods can eminently 
point to formalized testing adaptations, as
in a recent paper~\cite{DBLP:conf/popl/WickersonBSC17}, where formalizing the underlying relations
of memory models in Alloy
allowed the authors to generate tests that
distinguish subtly different 
memory consistency models, and many similar
analyses.

%\item 
Dynamic as well
as runtime verification methods
can draw immense benefits through
formal methods guided tools.
%
Formal methods can play
a significant role in all critical 
design choices such as 
flowing traces into a checker,
shifting between offline and online
analysis, and the use of statistical (sampling)
based approaches to reduce the amount of
tracing done while providing
probabilistic guarantees as
in~\cite{DBLP:conf/asplos/BurckhardtKMN10}.

Contracts and dynamic verification methods have been proposed by Thakur and Hovland (ANL).

 
 
 Formal methods are of unquestioned status in hardware design. Here are
 some examples:
 
\begin{itemize}
\item No chip ships without functional equivalence verification.

\item Floating-point hardware and cache coherence protocol engines on 
 microprocessors are formally verified for every major chip.
 
 \item Symbolic execution methods were applied to the Intel Core i7 microarchitecture, helping replace hours of wasteful conventional simulation and testing with formally driven execution that offers coverage guarantees [Kaivolaâ€™09]
 
\end{itemize}

Even so, full-chip formal verification is impractical.
But even here, semi-formal methods are employed, for example
assertions are expressed in languages such as System Verilog
and these properties are verified using industrial CAD tools
that employ the latest in BDD/SAT reasoning methods
including methods that perform property-driven reachability
and pruning based on methods such as
IC3 and Interpolation, 

While formal methods have not been widely applied to HPC
software, there are many promising formal and semi-formal
methods that show significant
promise \S\ref{sec:sw-fv-promising-methods}

   % deep compilation chains, KOKKOS, Raja; Their correctness
   
   \paragraph{Correctness of libraries}
   % verified math libraries
   
   \paragraph{Correctness of runtime systems support structures}
   % locks, transactions, ...

   % Interface automata, trace monitoring
   
   \paragraph{Formal Methods : Extensions needed
    to advance in HPC?}
    
     
\begin{itemize}
\item Computer-assisted proofs - need new theories, new techniques. One example is 1D wave equation (Stephen citation)



\item Statistical testing assertions. 

\item Hardware level traces collection 

\item Extensions to contracts to deal with concurrency dialects

\item Narrow gap between the low level traces and human understanding of the code - traceability backwards, explanation of errors, inverse mapping relation should be specified, abstractions, visualization techniques to explain correctness problems. Video game interface? :) 

\item AI alone isnâ€™t so powerful, human alone isnâ€™t so powerful => Centaur type of technologies. 

\end{itemize}

   \paragraph{Composing codes (from slides): New Research} 
   
 
\begin{itemize}
\item Contracts for specifying parts of a program (function, class, any module we want), have requirements, certain things are ensured.

\item For HPC there is a lot missing from contract languages, mostly anything that deals with concurrency

\item Data structures, the amount is large. Rewrite code to make data structures compatible, or translate and move back and forth. Bad options. Runtime costs, memory overhead, complexity in the code, data movement. Solution: clean interfaces. Performance reasons. Need to technique to get isolation while avoiding performance costs. 

\item How inefficient and unsafe existing solutions are


\item Modularization of the proofs. That is what contracts do for you. DSL proof languages . 

\item Deterministic automata, NASA example (Ganesh)

\item Using synthesis to learn model about the behavior of the code you donâ€™t understand.  Used in Android. (Armando example)

\item Need to verify that code meet the interface. 

\item IVY â€“ Microsoft (Koushik example) â€“ interface specification. Used to check tiling interface. Very close to interface automata. 

\item Issue of units of multi-physics code. Reference ontology? What it is that you are passing?  Fortress made a lot of noise about that. 

\item Mathematics of coupling codes are not well understood. Scale bridging is one of the big challenges. 

\end{itemize}
