{\large \textbf{A Hard-To-Debug Large-Scale Error}}\\
A bug in ddcMD, a parallel molecular-dynamic code, manifested as an
intermittent hang when run at large scale on BlueGene/L at LLNL.
It took a significant amount of person hours and debugging effort 
to find the root cause: a message race in which a process could 
hang waiting for a message that was intercepted by 
another process. More specifically, the hang occurred when 
two independent instances of a user-level I/O layer
were simultaneously processing two separate sets of buffers---an infrequent pattern that occurred when a small data set 
was written immediately after a large data set. Due to the 
semantics of MPI send/recv operations and the use of fixed tags, 
messages from a small set could be confused for those for a 
large set and vice versa, thus triggering the hang. 
Later, after the bug was fixed by the programmer, the bug was 
used in a blind study, in which researchers developed a tool 
to isolate this class of bugs without having details of the error 
(more in~\cite{PACTLaguna:2012}). This shows that documenting 
bug cases can be useful in developing and testing advanced 
correctness tool.
