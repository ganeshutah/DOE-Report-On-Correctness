Correctness of systems hinges
on having validated specifications
and
verification methods that find 
defects.
Challenges in these areas with
respect to
HPC include
the oracle problem, nondeterminism,
performance focus, concurrency,
scale, domain-specific mathematical
abstractions, the use of
floating-point arithmetic, 
and issues that stem from the
underlying programming language
and runtime support.
