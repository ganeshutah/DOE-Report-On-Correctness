\noindent Investments in these long-term directions will go a long way toward closing the gap between growing system complexity and verification capabilities:

\begin{compactitem}
\item A few ``moonshot'' projects, including  verification of fundamental logic and numerical properties in 
multi-physics applications.

\item Define   metrics 
for achievable and 
communicable levels of correctness, 
especially in simulations with geopolitical consequences, such as weather simulations.
