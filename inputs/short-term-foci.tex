\noindent The following short-term foci are overdue, in order to bootstrap the process and bring the community together:

\begin{compactitem}
\item Launch efforts to apply existing best-of-breed tools to challenge problems, extend those tools, and generally work with HPC applications code as-is.
%
These tools include existing commercial tools as well as those being developed within the research community.

\item Advance these tools to address cross-cutting concerns adequately (e.g., tie-in to debuggers and formal tools, instrument existing OpenMP and MPI runtimes to produce event streams, standardize verification tool design around such event streams).

\item Bringing advances from the non-HPC community to HPC. These measures could begin as modest as ensuring the capture and sharing of bugs and their fixes, and in general, incorporating lessons from Empirical Software Engineering~\cite{menzies-empirical-swe-SI2-2017}.

\item Learn
from other communities. 
For example, 
study and adapt techniques for concurrency verification from the embedded system verification community. Also, adapt techniques for verifying numerical computations from the cyberphysical systems community.
\end{compactitem}
