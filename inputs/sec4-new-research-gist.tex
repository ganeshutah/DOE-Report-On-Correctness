 New research in support of
 the correctness challenges in
 HPC is needed in the areas
 of static methods, methods that
have runtime system focus, 
numerical algorithm focus (with
emphasis on floating-point usage),
and focus on verifying compilers
and libraries.
The use of dynamic methods, debugging,
and many pragmatic thrusts (even smart
IDEs) can go a considerable way.
Rigorous methods are essential for
many aspects of concurrency, including
shared memory consistency models.
